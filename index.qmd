## Abstract

Air pollution still poses a significant health threat in our modern urban settings. For planning appropriate solutions, it is important to know the impacts on vulnerable populations. This study examines Pittsburgh, PA, to address two critical questions.

The main goals are to measure how the amounts of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) impact hospital admissions for respiratory diseases across different metropolitan neighborhoods. The relationship between pollutant exposures and health outcomes is examined to assess the disproportionate impacts of different environmental stressors on children and the elderly.

Secondly, we will use advanced data analysis methods for interactive visualization using R packages like ggplot2 and Shiny. These tools will not only display data trends but also enable users to dynamically investigate correlations. Utilizing linear regression techniques and explicit visual storytelling, we want to underscore the substantial correlation between air quality and public health.

This project aims to furnish data-driven insights to enable policymakers, urban planners, and community stakeholders in executing targeted initiatives for enhanced air quality and better health outcomes for Pittsburgh people. The primary objective is to create a healthier and more equitable urban environment for everyone.

## Introduction

Imagine a city where air that you breathe becomes a threat to your health yet invisible. For many people who live in Pittsburgh, PA, this is a real-life situation. Being an industrial town, Pittsburgh has seen a persistent battle against air pollution, predominantly the nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) varieties. These chemicals create social havoc by damaging the environment and seriously jeopardizing public health through respiratory ailments and rising hospital admission figures.

By analyzing the vast datasets from the neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, we hope to unravel how these pollutants impact the most at-risk groups, like children and the older population. We will merge our data on air pollution levels, respiratory outcomes, and demographic data to examine the complex vector relating environmental stressors to inequities in public health.

This is the main point of our research. First, we ask how NO₂ and SO₂ concentrations influence hospital admissions for respiratory conditions across Pittsburgh’s block groups. Second, we examine how pollution exposure differs by age, income, and other demographic factors, shedding light on disparities that disproportionately burden specific populations.

To tackle these questions, we harness the power of R programming, using tools like ggplot2 for impactful visualizations and Shiny for building interactive, user-friendly dashboards. These dashboards act as powerful tools for policymakers and community leaders, highlighting hotspots of concern and guiding targeted interventions to protect public health.

By illuminating these connections, this project strives to inform actionable change, enabling a healthier and more equitable Pittsburgh. The ultimate vision? A city where every breath is a step toward improved well-being and environmental justice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Discussion :**

When evaluating how gas concentrations, specifically NO₂ and SO₂, intersect with age-specific housing density and demographic patterns, a complex and multilayered narrative emerges. Our analysis, supported by visualizations, reveals striking patterns that provide insights into urban planning, public health, and environmental justice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Unveiling the Intersection of Age groups and Pollution**

Housing density serves as a critical factor influencing exposure to pollutants like NO₂ and SO₂. The findings consistently show that: - **Dense Urban Housing and NO₂**: Urban centers, characterized by tightly packed housing, are hotspots for NO₂ due to vehicular emissions and reduced air dispersion. This highlights the urgent need for cleaner public transport and urban green spaces to mitigate risks. - **Industrial Proximity and SO₂**: Block groups near industrial facilities experience higher SO₂ levels, affecting residents disproportionately in these areas. These findings suggest that zoning laws need stricter enforcement to separate residential spaces from industrial emissions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Age-Specific Impacts: Who is Most Vulnerable?**

The demographic breakdown highlights how different age groups are unequally impacted by pollution: - **Children in High-Density Areas**: With schools and family homes concentrated in urban areas, children face heightened exposure to NO₂. This could exacerbate respiratory conditions like asthma, underscoring the need for localized pollution control measures. - **Elderly in Suburban-Industrial Zones**: Seniors living near industrial zones show greater vulnerability to SO₂, as this age group often has pre-existing conditions that amplify the impact of pollutant exposure. - **Working Adults and Mixed-Use Zones**: While impacts on working-age adults are less pronounced, mixed residential-industrial areas pose potential risks that merit attention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Spatial and Statistical Insights**

-   **Spatial Clustering**: Heatmaps effectively visualize how pollutant concentrations cluster around urban centers (for NO₂) and industrial zones (for SO₂). This spatial distribution reinforces the connection between pollution sources and demographic vulnerabilities.
-   **Regression Models**: Statistical analysis supports these findings, with NO₂ levels showing strong correlations with urban housing density and SO₂ aligning more with industrial proximity and older demographics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Implications for Policy and Urban Planning**

1.  **Targeted Interventions**:\
    The results emphasize the need for targeted actions, such as:
    -   Expanding green buffers near highways and industrial zones.
    -   Enhancing air quality monitoring in high-risk neighborhoods.
2.  **Policy Development**:\
    Policies must address both immediate and long-term solutions:
    -   Enforcing stricter emissions standards.
    -   Incentivizing industries to adopt cleaner technologies.
3.  **Community Awareness and Engagement**:\
    Raising awareness about localized risks can empower communities to advocate for cleaner environments and adopt personal mitigation measures, such as air purifiers in homes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Evolving Urban Landscapes**

This discussion is particularly relevant in the context of rapidly urbanizing regions. As urbanization continues, the balance between housing density, industrial activity, and public health must be carefully managed. Visualizing these impacts helps stakeholders—from policymakers to urban planners—craft informed strategies to create healthier, more equitable communities.

These findings underline the urgency of integrating environmental and demographic considerations into urban planning, emphasizing the importance of proactive approaches to address pollution's far-reaching impacts.

## Conclusion

This project explores the critical links between air quality, public health, and demographic patterns in Pittsburgh, PA, focusing on the effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) on respiratory health. Our findings highlight significant health risks associated with air pollution, especially in urban centers and industrial zones. Elevated NO₂ levels are strongly correlated with increased hospital admissions in densely populated areas, disproportionately affecting children. Similarly, high SO₂ levels near industrial zones pose greater risks to older populations, illustrating the unequal distribution of environmental burdens.

The broader implications underscore the need for targeted healthcare interventions, strategic urban planning, and robust policymaking. Enhancing public transportation, enforcing stricter zoning laws, and creating green spaces can mitigate pollution exposure, while community awareness and engagement can empower individuals to reduce their risk. Policymakers can leverage these insights to implement stricter emission standards and promote cleaner industrial practices, addressing health disparities and fostering environmental justice.

Future directions for this research include expanding the scope to additional pollutants, conducting temporal and longitudinal studies, and integrating real-time data into interactive dashboards. These advancements can deepen our understanding of pollution's impacts and aid dynamic decision-making.

Ultimately, this study calls for collective action to ensure every Pittsburgh resident has access to clean air and improved health outcomes. By addressing these environmental challenges, Pittsburgh can become a model for equitable and sustainable urban living, benefiting all residents.
