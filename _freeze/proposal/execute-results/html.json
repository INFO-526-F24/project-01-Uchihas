Sourced from the American Community Survey.\n\n-   **PitPA_Floodplain**: This dataset maps flood-prone areas in Pittsburgh, with 1089 observations and 13 variables, providing insights into flood risks for different block groups.\n\n    -   **Reason for Choosing**:\n\n        -   These datasets offer a comprehensive view of the environmental and demographic factors influencing Pittsburgh's communities. They enable a dual focus on health impacts of air pollution and the relationship between flood risk and housing density.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\n#\\| label: analysis-plan #\\| message: false\n\n-   **Research Question 1**: How does the concentration of NO2 impact the rate of hospital admissions for respiratory conditions across different block groups in Pittsburgh, PA?\n\n    -   **Importance**: This question is crucial for understanding the direct impact of air pollution on community health, helping to inform public health interventions.\n\n    -   **Variables**:\n\n        -   **NO2 concentration** (Quantitative)\n\n        -   **Rate of hospital admissions for respiratory conditions** (Quantitative)\n\n        -   **Block group identifier** (Categorical)\n\n-   **Research Question 2**: How does the extent of land in floodplain zones affect housing density across different block groups in Pittsburgh, PA?\n\n    -   **Importance**: Investigating this relationship helps city planners understand how environmental risks shape housing patterns, leading to more resilient urban planning.\n\n    -   **Variables**:\n\n        -   **Percentage of land in 100-year floodplain** (Quantitative)\n\n        -   **Housing density** (Quantitative)\n\n        -   **Block group identifier** (Categorical)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n    #\\| label: analysis-plan #\\| message: false\n\n    -   **Analysis Plan for Research Question 1**:\n\n        -   **Data Preparation**:\n\n            -   Clean and filter the `benmap` dataset to retain relevant columns: `NO2 concentration`, `hospital_admissions`, and `bgrp`.\n\n            -   Merge with `bg_pop` to incorporate demographic controls if necessary.\n\n        -   **Visualization**:\n\n            -   Create a scatter plot of NO2 concentration against hospital admissions using `ggplot2`.\n\n            -   Use `geom_smooth()` to add a trend line and assess the strength of the relationship.\n\n            -   Use `leaflet` or `ggplot2` with spatial data to create a heatmap overlaying NO2 levels and hospital admission rates.\n\n        -   **Modeling**:\n\n            -   Use linear regression to model the relationship between NO2 concentration and hospital admissions.\n\n            -   Include demographic variables (e.g., population density) from `bg_pop` as controls to adjust for confounding factors.\n\n    -   **Analysis Plan for Research Question 2**:\n\n        -   **Data Preparation**:\n\n            -   Merge the `floodplain` dataset with `bg_pop` to align floodplain data with housing density.\n\n            -   Filter out block groups with minimal floodplain exposure to focus on areas with significant risk.\n\n        -   **Visualization**:\n\n            -   Create a scatter plot of the percentage of land in floodplains against housing density.\n\n            -   Use `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` to observe trends and relationships.\n\n            -   Create a bar chart or box plot to compare housing densities across different ranges of floodplain percentages.\n\n        -   **Modeling**:\n\n            -   Use linear regression to analyze the impact of floodplain percentage on housing density.\n\n            -   Consider using interaction terms to explore if the relationship differs across urban and suburban areas.\n\n                ### Next Steps\n\n                1.  **Data Cleaning**: Perform initial cleaning to handle missing values, ensure consistent column names, and validate data types.\n\n                2.  **Data Exploration**: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and potential outliers in the key variables.\n\n                3.  **Merge Datasets**: Use `left_join()` or `inner_join()` in `dplyr` to merge `benmap`, `bg_pop`, and `floodplain` datasets based on `bgrp` (block group identifier).\n\n                4.  **Visualization and Analysis**: Generate the planned visualizations and build statistical models to test hypotheses.\n\n                5.  **Interpretation**: Interpret the results in the context of urban planning and public health for Pittsburgh, PA.\n\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
